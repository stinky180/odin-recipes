            <li>Slice the carrots into quarters, about 1/8 of inch thick.</li>
            <li>Peal 5-8 garlic cloves.</li>
            <li>Cut the onion in half and save one half for <a href="street-tacos.html">street tacos</a>.</li>
            <li>Slice the onions length wise so they're skinny and long.</li>
            <li>Pour approximately 1 cup of white vinegar into a medium size pot.</li>
            <li>Place pot on to a stove at medium/high heat.</li>
            <li>Once the vinegar starts to steam lightly, add approximately 2 tablespoons of salt and pour 2 tablespoons of pepper corn into the pot.</li>
            <li>Stir the mixture until the salt is dissolved.</li>
            <li>Place the carrots, onions, garlic, and 2 bay leafs into the mixture.</li>
            <li>Cook for approximately 5 minutes on medium/high. Stir occasionally</li>

            <li>Using tongs, place all vegetables into a mason jar. Once the mason jar is approximately 3/4 full, pour the vinegar mixture into the jar leaving a little space at the top.</li>
